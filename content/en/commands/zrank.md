Returns the rank of `member` in the sorted set stored at `key`, with the scores
ordered from low to high.
The rank (or index) is 0-based, which means that the member with the lowest
score has rank `0`.

Use [`ZREVRANK`](/commands/zrevrank) to get the rank of an element with the scores ordered from high
to low.
