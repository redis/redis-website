Returns the rank of `member` in the sorted set stored at `key`, with the scores
ordered from high to low.
The rank (or index) is 0-based, which means that the member with the highest
score has rank `0`.

Use [`ZRANK`](/commands/zrank) to get the rank of an element with the scores ordered from low to
high.
